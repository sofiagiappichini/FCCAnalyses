###Input directory where the files produced at the pre-selection level are
baseDir  = "ZH_mumu_recoil/stage2/"

###Link to the dictonary that contains all the cross section informations etc...
procDict = os.path.join(os.getenv('FCCDICTSDIR', deffccdicts), '') + "FCCee_procDict_spring2021_IDEA.json"

###Process list that should match the produced files. 
process_list=['p8_ee_ZZ_ecm240','p8_ee_WW_ecm240','MySample_p8_ee_ZH_ecm240']

###Add MySample_p8_ee_ZH_ecm240 as it is not an offical process
procDictAdd={"MySample_p8_ee_ZH_ecm240":{"numberOfEvents": 10000000, "sumOfWeights": 10000000, "crossSection": 0.201868, "kfactor": 1.0, "matchingEfficiency": 1.0}}

###Dictionnay of the list of cuts. The key is the name of the selection that will be added to the output file
cut_list = {"sel0":"Zcand_q == 0",
            "sel1":"Zcand_q == -1 || Zcand_q == 1",
            "sel2":"Zcand_m > 80 && Zcand_m < 100",
            "sel3":"MyFilter==true && (Zcand_m < 80 || Zcand_m > 100)"
            }


###Dictionary for the ouput variable/hitograms. The key is the name of the variable in the output files. "name" is the name of the variable in the input file, "title" is the x-axis label of the histogram, "bin" the number of bins of the histogram, "xmin" the minimum x-axis value and "xmax" the maximum x-axis value.
variables = {
    "mz":{"name":"Zcand_m","title":"m_{Z} [GeV]","bin":125,"xmin":0,"xmax":250},
    "mz_zoom":{"name":"Zcand_m","title":"m_{Z} [GeV]","bin":40,"xmin":80,"xmax":100},
    "leptonic_recoil_m":{"name":"Zcand_recoil_m","title":"Z leptonic recoil [GeV]","bin":100,"xmin":0,"xmax":200},
