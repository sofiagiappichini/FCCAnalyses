### Preliminary analyses
Using the corresponding ```FCCAnalyses``` [ZH_Zmumu](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCAnalyses/tree/master/FCCeeAnalyses/Higgs/mH-recoil/mumu) and [ZH_Zee](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCAnalyses/tree/master/FCCeeAnalyses/Higgs/mH-recoil/ee) and using the input files in ```edm4hep``` of this [sample production](http://fcc-physics-events.web.cern.ch/fcc-physics-events/Delphesevents_fccee_tmp.php), produced ```FlatNtuples``` and ```histograms``` used to fit the recoil: ```/eos/experiment/fcc/ee/analyses/case-studies/higgs/mH-recoil/FlatNtuples/```.
